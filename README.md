#Generic C# Geocoding API [![Build Status](http://teamcity.chadly.net/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:GeocodingNe_Build)/statusIcon)](http://teamcity.chadly.net/viewType.html?buildTypeId=GeocodingNe_Build&guest=1)

Includes a model and interface for communicating with five popular Geocoding providers.  Current implementations include:

  * [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) - [docs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/)
  * [Yahoo! BOSS Geo Services](http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/) - [docs](http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/placefinder/guide/index.html)
  * [Bing Maps (aka Virtual Earth)](http://www.microsoft.com/maps/) - [docs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701715.aspx)
  * :warning: MapQuest [(Comercial API)](http://www.mapquestapi.com/) - [docs](http://www.mapquestapi.com/geocoding/)
  * :warning: MapQuest [(OpenStreetMap)](http://open.mapquestapi.com/) - [docs](http://open.mapquestapi.com/geocoding/)

The API returns latitude/longitude coordinates and normalized address information.  This can be used to perform address validation, real time mapping of user-entered addresses, distance calculations, and much more.

See latest [release notes](https://github.com/chadly/Geocoding.net/releases/latest).

:warning: There are some open issues ([#29](https://github.com/chadly/Geocoding.net/issues/29), [#45](https://github.com/chadly/Geocoding.net/issues/45), [#48](https://github.com/chadly/Geocoding.net/issues/48)) regarding MapQuest which have some workarounds. If you would like to help fix the issues, PRs are welcome.

##Installation

Install [via nuget](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Geocoding.net/):

```
Install-Package Geocoding.net
```

Or download the [latest release](https://github.com/chadly/Geocoding.net/releases/latest) and add a reference to `Geocoding.dll` in your project.

##Example Usage

###Simple Example

```csharp
IGeocoder geocoder = new GoogleGeocoder() { ApiKey = "this-is-my-optional-google-api-key" };
IEnumerable<Address> addresses = geocoder.Geocode("1600 pennsylvania ave washington dc");
Console.WriteLine("Formatted: " + addresses.First().FormattedAddress); //Formatted: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave SE, Washington, DC 20003, USA
Console.WriteLine("Coordinates: " + addresses.First().Coordinates.Latitude + ", " + addresses.First().Coordinates.Longitude); //Coordinates: 38.8791981, -76.9818437
```

It can also be used to return address information from latitude/longitude coordinates (aka reverse geocoding):

```csharp
IGeocoder geocoder = new YahooGeocoder("consumer-key", "consumer-secret");
IEnumerable<Address> addresses = geocoder.ReverseGeocode(38.8976777, -77.036517);
```

###Using Provider-Specific Data

```csharp
GoogleGeocoder geocoder = new GoogleGeocoder();
IEnumerable<GoogleAddress> addresses = geocoder.Geocode("1600 pennsylvania ave washington dc");

var country = addresses.Where(a => !a.IsPartialMatch).Select(a => a[GoogleAddressType.Country]).First();
Console.WriteLine("Country: " + country.LongName + ", " + country.ShortName); //Country: United States, US
```

The Microsoft and Yahoo implementations each provide their own address class as well, `BingAddress` and `YahooAddress`.

###More Examples

A more in-depth runnable example of how this library can be integrated into an MVC4 application can be found in the [latest release package](https://github.com/chadly/Geocoding.net/releases/latest). Download it and run locally.

##API Keys

Google allows anonymous access to it's API, but if you start hitting rate limits, you must [sign up for a new Server API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key).

Bing [requires an API key](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx) to access its service.

You will need a [consumer secret and consumer key](http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/BOSS_Signup.pdf) (PDF) for Yahoo.

MapQuest API requires a key. Sign up here: (http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open)

##How to Build from Source

Open in Visual Studio 2013 and build. It should automatically restore nuget package dependencies. If you get an error about a missing `AssemblyVersion` file, close the solution and reopen it and build again. The build depends on some `.targets` files that are downloaded from nuget. If the files aren't there when VS opens, it doesn't detect that they are there once nuget downloads them without a restart.

### Service Tests
You will need to generate API keys for each respective service to run the service tests. Edit App.config in the Tests project and put in your API keys.
